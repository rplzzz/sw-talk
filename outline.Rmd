### Excerpt 

go to the speaker view tab (the private one) and do following sequence:
open press F12 to open developer tools (works with chrome, firefox and IE10)
switch to console tab
paste this code and execute it:
Reveal.configure({
  keyboard: {
    40: 'next',
    38: 'prev'
  }
});
press F12 again to close the developer tools

Slides.com (and reveal.js itself) works in the browser and browsers have its own key codes which you can use in JavaScript code. This is the important part of the table:

left arrow	37
up arrow	38
right arrow	39
down arrow	40

It should be possible to make this load automatically via an appropriate include.
