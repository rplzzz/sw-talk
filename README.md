# Stop Writing Bad Science Code

Between them, the authors have logged many years as developers, collaborators, and supervisors on scientific
software projects.  Over that span, we've seen a lot of bad science code (some of which we perpetrated ourselves, 
much to our chagrin).  Nobody expects scientists to be star software developers, but the fact is, these days you 
simply can't do science without being at least a part time software developer.  Even a simple data analysis task 
involves (or _should_ involve!) writing a program to reproduce the analysis on demand.  Basic familiarity with
some best practices for developing scientific software will make you dramatically more productive as a scientist.
In this talk we share some tips for avoiding the main pitfalls that lead to bad science code.
